#R Programming

###Week 1: Writing code/ setting your working directory

* `getwd()`: get working directory

* `dir()`or `ls()`: list files

* ```R
  myfunction <- function(x){
      y <- rnorm(100)
      mean(y)
  }
  
  second <- function(x){
      x + norm(length(x))
  }
  ```

* save functions as function.R | `source("myfunction.R")` | `myfunction(x) or second(x)` 

* Asking Questions

  * What steps will reproduce the problem?
  * What is the expected output?
  * What do you see instead?
  * What version of the product (e.g. R, packages, etc.) are you using?
  * What operating system?
