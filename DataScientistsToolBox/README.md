### R Packages

* Installing an R package 
  * `install.package(c("packagename1","packagename2","packagename3"))`
  * Here 'c'  means 'character vector'.
* Loading R packages
  * `library(packagename)`
  * Do not put the package name in quotes
  * fuctions exported can be viewed `search()`

### Data Science Questions

* **descriptive analysis**: describe the data \& describe what is going on.
* **exploratory analysis**: find relationship you didn't know about. No need to know why but there is the relationship.
* **inferential analysis**: use a relatively small sample of data to infer the phenomenon about a bigger population.
* **predictive analysis**: to use the data on some objects to predict values for another object.
* **causal analysis**: to find out what happens to one variable when you make another variable change. "gold standard" for data analysis.
* **mechanistic analysis**: understand the exact changes in variables that lead to changes in other variables for individual objects.

### Data

* a set of items
* variables: qualitative or quantitative
* where: data.gov
* have a question with your data is very important.

### Big Data

### Experimental Design

* correlation is not causation.
* fix, stratify and randomize
* data dredging
